I am a passionate about IT, prone to learn every day and with the bias to action. In more than 10 years of experience I have tried many different areas, from Java Servlets/JSPs to Web 2.0 apps using Jquery, integration side using Jboss and Mule ESB, passing by the purist developer side in Redhat where I was playing around with OSGI, Fuse and Switchyard, discovering the functional side with Scala, Cats, working in Big Data with Spark and Hadoop and flying around in the Amazon Cloud.

### More Information

Apart from IT, that is one of my passions, the other passion is the sports and healthy lifestyle. 

In 2018 thanks to my friend Javier Furio, I started this crazyness of triathlons and ironmans. This is the list of races I have completed:

* Wales Full IronMan (2018 September)
* Edinburgh Half IronMan (2018 July)
* Hackney Half Marathon (2018 May)
* Madrid Marathon (2018 April)
* Oxford Half Marathon (October 2017)
* Woldingham Marathon (July 2017)
